### Problem to solve

<!-- What problem do we solve? -->

### Target audience

<!-- For whom are we doing this? Include either a persona from https://design.gitlab.com/getting-started/personas
or define a specific company role. e.a. "Release Manager" or "Security Analyst" -->

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? -->

### Documentation

<!--
* What doc pages need to be created or updated across user, admin, and API docs?
* What concepts, procedures, or information is needed in each area? Is there an 'old way' to deprecate in docs?

Product managers:
* By the kickoff, finalize the answers to the bullets above, and:
  * If applicable, specify new or updated feature name(s), description(s), benefits,
    and use cases, which may all be used in the documentation or features.yml.
  * Specify which use cases or scenarios would benefit from a set of instructions
    or a guide unique to that use case. -->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this -->
