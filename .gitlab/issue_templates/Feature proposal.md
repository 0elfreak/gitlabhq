### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals (contributes to our vision?) -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey -->

### Documentation

<!-- See the Documentation Workflows https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html and specify the following:
What doc pages need to be created or updated across user, admin, and API docs?
What concepts, procedures, or information is needed in each area? Is there an 'old way' that should be deprecated in the docs?
If applicable, specify a new or updated feature name, description, benefits, and use cases, which may all be used in the documentation or features.yml.
Which use cases or scenarios would benefit from a set of instructions or a guide, whether unique to each use case or flexible enough to cover multiple use cases. -->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. -->
